Excited to share our latest review on modeling cellular dynamics was accepted by **Entropy**! :tada: :tada: We explore how scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and advanced computational tools reveal **spatiotemporal cell trajectories and fate decisions**. Huge thanks to my collaborators, Yuhao, Qiangwei, and my advisors Prof. Tiejun Li and Dr. Peijie Zhou.
