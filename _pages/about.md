I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in computational mathematics at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Tiejun Li](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/litj/) and I am co-advised by Dr. [Peijie Zhou](https://cliffzhou92.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree (2023) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Cuiying Honors College](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn), Lanzhou University.  

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics.  My interest is to combine mathematics with  machine intelligence to tackle practical challenges  across diverse fields and advance our comprehension of fundamental principles and mechanisms. That’s what I want to pursue in the future.

My current research interests lie in 
- **Physics-informed generative modeling**: computational methods based on optimal transport, Schrödinger bridge, etc. 
- **Computational systems biology**: generation of spatiotemporal cellular dynamics based on multi-omics data.
- **AI for science**: applications of AI in climate change and medicine, etc.
